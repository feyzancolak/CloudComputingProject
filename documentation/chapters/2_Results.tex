\subsection{Dataset}
In order to complete this letter frequncy analysis through Hadoop, several datasets of different sizes were used. 

The smallest datasets are about the theatrical piece \textit{Seagull} by Anton Chekhov. Each file is approximately 100KB and includes: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The English translation
    \item The Italian translation
    \item The Turkish translation
\end{itemize}

The medium datasets are about the \textit{Lord Of The Rings} trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien. Each file is approximately 3MB and includes: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The original English text
    \item The Italian translation
    \item The Turkish translation
\end{itemize}

The largest dataset is a collection of 5 Million book reviews in English from Goodreads. This dataset is about 3GB. 
 
The datasets are stored in HDFS and were processed by the Hadoop MapReduce framework. The results of the analysis were stored in HDFS and were later retrieved and analyzed.

\section{Performance}
The performance of the Hadoop MapReduce framework was tested on the English datasets. This allowed us to see the difference peformances for the different
sizes with the different number of reducers and the use of the different algorithms. \\

\subsection{General Observations}

For small file sizes, there is no substantial difference in performance between the various Hadoop algorithms. However,
as the file size increases, significant differences in performance become apparent. Specifically, the inMapper algorithms
show greater efficiency, particularly regarding execution times. When looking at metrics such as the total time spent by
all reduce and map tasks, CPU time spent, and garbage collection time elapsed, the inMapper approaches outperform the
Combiner approaches for larger file sizes. This improved efficiency with inMapper algorithms becomes more evident
as the file size increases.\\ \\
Regarding memory usage, the inMapper algorithms demonstrate slightly better performance compared to the Combiner algorithms.
Although the differences are not as noticeable as those observed in execution times, the inMapper algorithms consistently
show an advantage in terms of memory efficiency, especially for larger files. This includes both peak physical and virtual
memory used during map and reduce tasks.\\ \\
Increasing the number of reducers did not lead to performance improvements for the file sizes used in the tests. Instead,
it generally resulted in increased resource usage and longer execution times due to the management overhead of additional reducer tasks.
However, for very large file sizes, such as 3GB, performance tends to stabilize with an increased number of reducers.
In some instances, slight improvements are observed, suggesting that for even larger file sizes, substantial performance gains could be achieved
by increasing the number of reducers. This indicates a potential for significant performance enhancements with more reducers for files
larger than those tested, as the workload can be distributed more effectively.

\section{Frequency}
The frequency of the letters was tested in English, Italian and Turkish using the small (Seagull) and medium (Lord of the Rings) datasets. 
This allowed to compare frequency differences between the languages and the different sizes datasets.\\ \\
Below it can be seen the results of the frequency analysis for the small and medium datasets for each languages.

\subsection{General Observations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item In each language \textit{A} and \text{E} are the most frequent letters.
    \item \textit{T} has significantly more priority in English than the other languages.
    \item The frequency order of the letter in the same language is almost the same for the small and medium dataset.
    \item \textit{Q} and \textit{X} are the common few frequent letters in all languages.
    \item In general the vowel of the languages are more frequent than the consonants.
\end{itemize}
