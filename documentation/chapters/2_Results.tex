\subsection{Dataset}
In order to complete this letter frequncy analysis through Hadoop, several datasets of different sizes were used. 

The smallest datasets are about the theatrical piece \textit{Seagull} by Anton Chekhov. Each file is approximately 100KB and includes: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The English translation
    \item The Italian translation
    \item The Turkish translation
\end{itemize}

The medium datasets are about the \textit{Lord Of The Rings} trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien. Each file is approximately 3MB and includes: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The original English text
    \item The Italian translation
    \item The Turkish translation
\end{itemize}

The largest dataset is a collection of 5 Million book reviews in English from Goodreads. This dataset is about 3GB. 
 
The datasets are stored in HDFS and were processed by the Hadoop MapReduce framework. The results of the analysis were stored in HDFS and were later retrieved and analyzed.

\section{Performance}
The performance of the Hadoop MapReduce framework was tested on the English datasets. This allowed us to see the difference peformances for the different sizes with the different number of reducers.

\section{Frequency}
The frequency of the letters was tested in English, Italian and Turkish using the small (Seagull) and medium (Lord of the Rings) datasets. 
This allowed to compare frequency differences between the languages and the different sizes datasets.\\ \\
Below it can be seen the results of the frequency analysis for the small and medium datasets for each languages.

\textbf{Obtanied Results:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In each language \textit{A} and \text{E} are the most frequent letters.
    \item \textit{T} has significantly more priority in English than the other languages.
    \item The frequency order of the letter in the same language is almost the same for the small and medium dataset.
    \item \textit{Q} and \textit{X} are the common few frequent letters in all languages.
    \item In general the vowel of the languages are more frequent than the consonants.
\end{itemize}
